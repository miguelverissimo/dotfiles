# dotfiles and basic computer setup

These are my current dotfiles. I got this from all over the internet, but the main sources of inspiration (copy) were:

* [skwp's YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles)
* [Luan's nvim](https://github.com/luan/nvim)
* [bosh team's worstation setup](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-workstation)
